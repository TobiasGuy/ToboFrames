TODO LIST

Find all frames that need resizing
Store the scale chosen, default to 1
Make sure the scale applies after relog + reload
Make interface with slider? or just chat command? decide later, chat command for now
Profiles? (Global profile for all characters because it's really annoying for users if not)
Define usage in description
Figure out how to do the release version stuff on github
Post on addon site
Scale seems quite high atm, maybe dilute the numbers a bit
List of all frames that you can checkmark to resize or not? checkmark all by default
